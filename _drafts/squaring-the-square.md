We prove that every square can be partitioned into $n$ squares for every $n \geq 6$.

This problem belongs to a family of problems known as [*squaring the square*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_square). What I particularly like about this problem is that the problem statement can be understood by anyone of almost any age, and this problem admits some elegant solutions.

First, let us better understand the problem statement. To "partition a square" means to tile the square with other squares. For example, consider the simple cases of $n=1$ and $n=4$, which are shown in TODO

In general, it is often a good idea to "play" with the problem statement by considering examples and counter-examples, which gives you a better sense of how to proceed.

For example, consider the simplest case of $n = 1$. Although the problem statement does not consider this case, this case will prove to be useful later on. Clearly, a square can be partitioned into a single square, which is just the square itself. Next,
